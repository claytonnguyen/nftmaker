# nftmaker
a solidity contract that can deploy an ERC721 token (NFT)

followed a tutorial on logrocket "how to create nfts with javascript"

In a recent openzeppelin update, one function is gone and ruins the functionality of pulling data from a URI supplied on IPFS. Used a workaround
and now it works.

Another TLDR, I created this project on a local directory before initializing a empty github repo and tried to push changes to this repo after
the fact and it would not work

A workaround I found was to push to the branch "master" and not main.
